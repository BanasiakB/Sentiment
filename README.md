### Disclaimer

sometimes the sentiment command doesn't work in windows if the package is installed globally.

to avoid this, install the package in a local virtual env

first, create a env

```sh
python3 -m venv env_for_sentiment
```

activate that env

```sh
.\env_for_sentiment\Scripts\activate
```

and then pip install. But you will have to activate that env everytime you want to use sentiment.
